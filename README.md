# Camera Trap Data Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end ecological data analysis using camera trap data.
It focuses on summarizing species observations, sex ratios, and spatial patterns using Python.

The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, species-wise summaries,
sex-based analysis, data visualization, and preparation of GIS-ready datasets.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Ecological data analysis
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization
- Preparing spatial data for GIS workflows

## Data Source
Camera trap dataset sourced from an open-access Mendeley Data repository.
The data is used strictly for academic and skill demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure
- data/raw → Original datasets
- data/cleaned → Cleaned and processed datasets
- notebooks → Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
- outputs → Figures generated from the analysis

## Key Outputs
- Species-wise abundance summaries
- Species × Sex count and percentage analysis
- Bar plots and density heatmaps
- GIS-ready camera trap point dataset

## Repository Status
This repository represents a completed end-to-end analysis pipeline.
Data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and GIS-ready exports are finalized.

## Next Steps
- Spatial visualization in QGIS
- Camera trap distribution mapping
- Habitat suitability and corridor analysis

## Future Use
This project feeds directly into GIS-based spatial analysis and ecological modelling workflows.

## How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   notebooks/CameraTrap_Analysis.ipynb
